hero: An initiative to break the conventional barriers of PC only coding

<img class="mch-logo" src="images/MCH_LOGO.svg" height="20%" width="20%">
# Our Motive
We were the first ones who recognised the need of mobile coding 

At MCH, we aspire to make the masses aware about the possibilities of mobile coding.
May it be your phone, tablet or browser on a toaster

We are trying our best to keep the website free of any advertisement to give the best experience to the users.

You are welcome to give any suggestions or opinions on our [Discord Server](support.md).
Have a happy stay :smiley:!

    Don't know how mobile they are!

## Pros and Cons of Mobile Coding
Just like any other thing, Mobile Coding has its own features and its own set of problems.
We won't just let you dive into this world without you know everything(or most of the stuff)
about it

### Pros
* Best alternative for those who don't already have a PC or have a really old one
* Best for prototyping
* More utility out of a product you already have
* Portability - Code Anywhere, Take it with you anywhere!
* Fix bugs on the fly
* Get notifications directly
* Easier to run scripts in background
* Better for people who don't want to buy a raspberry pie or host a VPS(Though we will teach you how you can do this as well)

### Cons
* Can lead to device overheating
    !!! note
        Though if you can run games in high quality then it shouldn't be a problem
* Mobile Data Charges usually very high in some countries
* Restrictions on Battery Life
* Less Upgradability
    > The most you can easily do is to increase the storage space
* Less efficient if you can type on a keyboard with >55-60wpm
* Mobile Phone aren't meant to run background  tasks at full efficiency.
* Running script in foreground for too long can result in reduced display life
