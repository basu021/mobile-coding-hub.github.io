hero: The things you need to begin coding on your mobile
title: Getting Started

# Getting Started
The first thing you need is a device which is portable enough!
A laptop comes under the category of a PC so it is out of our scope.

## Things you need:

### Pre-requisites
* An Android Device [Possibly with Android version 5.0 or above]
* Any Browser 
* An App Store/Play Store

!!! note "For the purpose of this guide, we will be using:"
    * An Android 5.0 device
    * Google Chrome as the broswer
    * Play Store as our App Store

#### Scripting App
First of all we need some place where we can run our scripts. It won't be fun without that, will it?

There are several options for this:

* [Termux](../termux) [Requires Android 5.0 or above]
* Debian NoRoot
* PyDroid [Only for Python scripts]
* SL4A
and many more ...

!!! note "For the purpose of this guide, we will mostly be using:"
    [Termux](../termux) - Because of it's light weight, reliablilty and sleek design!

#### Writing Code
Then you need some tool where you can write code!
You can write in your termminal or some application.

For terminal, you can use:

* Nano
* Vim
* Emacs etc,

For apps, there are some really good tools:

* DroidEdit
* PyDroid [Only for Python scripts] etc,.
